# Project Description

The code in this project was used in a research paper to compare the resource allocation of Offices of Inspector Generals' on the federal level between investigation and auditing functions.

The prevailing literature pertaining to Federal Offices of Inspector General's (OIG) claims that more OIG resources would be used towards investigation vs auditing functions.
This research project shows that OIGs, generally, designate more resources towards auditing functions than investigation functions.

The procedure uses DuckDB (version 7.1) for the data processing, and R for the creation of the data visualization.

## Usage Instructions

1. Make sure you have the command line version of DuckDB downloaded. (https://duckdb.org/#quickinstall)
2. Make sure you have R installed and the following packages `Require`, `duckdb` , `ggplot2` , and `lubridate`. (The script will download them if they aren't installed beforehand.)
3. Open the downloaded directory in your terminal and run `scripts/0_the_whole_procedure.sh`
